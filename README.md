## About.
Many cemeteries around where I live don’t seem to have any form of digital records. If you wanted to find out if someone is buried in a cemetery, you would either have to go and look for yourself or hope the local church has some physical records.  This software will hopefully fix that by allowing indexing of sections, cemetery plots and graves. 

While there is similar software out there, from what I can see, its paid. You are either buying the software outright or it’s a tiered subscription that caps out on how many records you can enter. This software will be free and allow for management of cemeteries of any size. 

## Technologies. 
### Languages:
Python 3.10+
SQL / SQLite
